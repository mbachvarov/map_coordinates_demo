; THE ACRYLIC DNS PROXY CACHING MECHANISM EXPLAINED
;
; When Acrylic receives a DNS request from a client the hosts cache (a static cache contained in the AcrylicHosts.txt
; file) is searched first. If nothing is found there the request is subsequently searched in the address cache (a
; dynamic cache contained in the AcrylicCache.dat file). At this point three things may happen:
;
; CASE 1: The request is not found in the address cache or its corresponding response is older than
; "AddressCacheScavengingTime" minutes: In this case the original request is forwarded to all of the configured DNS
; servers simultaneously. The response to the client is delayed until the first one of the DNS servers comes out with a
; valid response (all the others will be discarded).
;
; CASE 2: The request is found in the address cache and its corresponding response is older than
; "AddressCacheSilentUpdateTime" minutes but not older than "AddressCacheScavengingTime minutes": In this case the
; response to the client is sent immediately from the address cache and the original request is also forwarded to all of
; the configured DNS servers like in the previous case. The first response coming from one of the DNS servers will be
; used to silently update the address cache (all the others will be discarded).
;
; CASE 3: The request is found in the address cache and its corresponding response is younger than
; "AddressCacheSilentUpdateTime" minutes: In this case the response to the client is sent immediately from the address
; cache and no network activity with any of the configured DNS servers will occur.
;
; To minimize disk activity the address cache is flushed from memory to disk only when the Acrylic DNS Proxy service is
; stopped or the system is shut down. Thus you won't see anything change in the AcrylicCache.dat file until you stop the
; Acrylic DNS Proxy service or shut down the system.
;
; And now about the caching parameters:
;
; The time to live (in minutes) of a failure response in the address cache.
;
AddressCacheFailureTime=0
;
; The time to live (in minutes) of a negative response in the address cache.
;
AddressCacheNegativeTime=10
;
; The time to live (in minutes) of a positive response in the address cache.
;
AddressCacheScavengingTime=960
;
; The time (in minutes) elapsed which an item in the address cache must be silently updated should a request occur.
;
AddressCacheSilentUpdateTime=240
;
; You can disable any disk activity related to the address cache by choosing Yes instead of No. If you do that Acrylic
; will still use the address cache but won't load it from disk upon startup and won't save it to disk upon shutdown.
;
AddressCacheInMemoryOnly=No
;
; You can disable the address cache altogether by choosing Yes instead of No. If you do that Acrylic will work as a
; forwarding-only DNS proxy.
;
AddressCacheDisabled=No
;
; The local IPv4 address to which Acrylic binds. A value of 0.0.0.0 indicates that Acrylic should bind to all available
; addresses and as such it will be able to receive DNS requests coming from all of your network interfaces. A value
; corresponding to the IPv4 address of one of them instead will allow Acrylic to receive DNS requests only from that
; specific network interface. An empty value instead indicates that no binding should occur on IPv4.
;
LocalIPv4BindingAddress=0.0.0.0
;
; The local UDPv4 port to which Acrylic binds. The default value of 53 is the standard port for DNS resolution. You
; should change this value only if you are using a non standard DNS client.
;
LocalIPv4BindingPort=53
;
; The local IPv6 address to which Acrylic binds. A value of 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0 indicates that Acrylic should bind to all
; available addresses and as such it will be able to receive DNS requests coming from all of your network interfaces. A
; value corresponding to the IPv6 address of one of them instead will allow Acrylic to receive DNS requests only from
; that specific network interface. An empty value instead indicates that no binding should occur on IPv6.
;
LocalIPv6BindingAddress=0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0
;
; The local UDPv6 port to which Acrylic binds. The default value of 53 is the standard port for DNS resolution. You
; should change this value only if you are using a non standard DNS client.
;
LocalIPv6BindingPort=53
;
; On Windows versions prior to Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008 the IPv6 protocol is usually not installed by
; default. For Windows 2000 there is a Microsoft IPv6 Technology Preview package available for download while for
; Windows XP the IPv6 protocol must be added to the list of available network protocols in your network connection
; Properties window.
;
; If you want to enable local IPv6 binding for Acrylic on Windows versions prior to Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008
; you can choose Yes below after having installed all the necessary prerequisites.
;
LocalIPv6BindingEnabledOnWindowsVersionsPriorToWindowsVistaOrWindowsServer2008=No
;
; The time to live (in seconds) set for DNS responses generated by Acrylic (e.g. the ones generated from mappings
; contained in the Acrylic HOSTS file).
;
GeneratedResponseTimeToLive=300
;
; The maximum time (in milliseconds) to wait for a response coming from a DNS server configured with the UDP protocol.
;
ServerUdpProtocolResponseTimeout=4999
;
; The maximum time (in milliseconds) to wait for the first byte of a response coming from a DNS server configured with
; the TCP protocol.
;
ServerTcpProtocolResponseTimeout=4999
;
; The maximum time (in milliseconds) to wait for an intra communication packet of a response coming from a DNS server
; configured with the TCP protocol.
;
ServerTcpProtocolInternalTimeout=2477
;
; The maximum times (in milliseconds) to wait for the below events when communicating with a proxy server on behalf of a
; DNS server configured with the SOCKS5 protocol.
;
ServerSocks5ProtocolProxyFirstByteTimeout=2477
ServerSocks5ProtocolProxyOtherBytesTimeout=2477
ServerSocks5ProtocolProxyRemoteConnectTimeout=2477
ServerSocks5ProtocolProxyRemoteResponseTimeout=4999
;
; The hit log is a text file into which every DNS request and DNS response seen by Acrylic can be logged.
;
; It is activated by specifying a non-empty value for the HitLogFileName parameter and contains rows with the following
; TAB-separated fields:
;
; 1. A timestamp in the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.FFF.
; 2. The source IP address of the DNS request (for HCF description codes) or response (for RU description codes).
; 3. The description code:
;        H => Resolved from the hosts cache
;        C => Resolved from the address cache
;        F => Forwarded to at least one of the DNS servers
;        R => Received from one of the configured DNS servers
;        U => Silent update from one of the configured DNS servers
; 4. The dissected DNS request (for HCF description codes) or response (for RU description codes).
;
; A dissected DNS request looks like:
;
; Q[1]=x.com;T[1]=A
;
; Where:
;
; 1. Q[1]=x.com means that DNS question 1 refers to the "x.com" domain name.
; 2. T[1]=A means that DNS question 1 is of type A (IPv4).
;
; A dissected DNS response is like:
;
; RC=0;QDC=1;ANC=2;Q[1]=x.com;T[1]=CNAME;A[1]=x.com>y.com;T[2]=A;A[2]=y.com>1.2.3.4
;
; Where:
;
; 1. RC=0 means that the DNS response code (RCODE) is 0.
; 2. QDC=1 means that the number of questions (QDCOUNT) contained in the DNS response is 1.
; 3. ANC=2 means that the number of answers (ANCOUNT) contained in the DNS response is 2.
; 4. Q[1]=x.com means that the DNS question 1 refers to the "x.com" domain name.
; 5. T[1]=CNAME means that the DNS answer 1 is of type CNAME (canonical name).
; 6. A[1]=x.com>y.com means that the DNS answer 1 that refers to the "x.com" domain name is "y.com".
; 7. T[2]=A means that the DNS answer 2 is of type A (IPv4).
; 8. A[2]=y.com>1.2.3.4 means that the DNS answer 2 that refers to the "y.com" domain name is "1.2.3.4".
;
; For performance reasons the hit log is flushed to disk only when Acrylic is idle or when the hit log memory buffer is
; full, therefore you might experience a delay of a few seconds between when a DNS request or a DNS response is received
; and when its details get written into the hit log. Furthermore, since writing each entry into the hit log requires its
; full dissection, activating the hit log does incur a performance penalty, although it might become noticeable only
; when Acrylic is used as the DNS server of a large number of clients.
;
; Regarding the HitLogFileName you can use an absolute or a relative path and a sort of daily log rotation can be
; achieved by including the %DATE% template within the file name. A complete list of all the templates you can use
; within the file name is shown below:
;
; %DATE%
; The current date in YYYYMMDD format.
;
; %TEMP%
; The current value of the TEMP environment variable.
;
; %APPDATA%
; The current value of the APPDATA environment variable.
;
; %LOCALAPPDATA%
; The current value of the LOCALAPPDATA environment variable.
;
; Examples:
;
; HitLogFileName=HitLog.%DATE%.txt
; HitLogFileName=%TEMP%\AcrylicDNSProxyHitLog.%DATE%.txt
;
HitLogFileName=
;
; The filter (a combination of one or more of the description codes shown above) which controls what is written into the
; hit log and what isn't.
;
HitLogFileWhat=HCFRU
;
; You can force Acrylic to write the hit log using the old (0.9.24) format by uncommenting the following line. The new
; format is richer but you may still want to use the old one for compatibility with an already existing log analyzer.
;
; HitLogFileMode=Legacy
;
; The minimum number of hit log entries that can be flushed to disk during Acrylic's idle cicle.
;
HitLogMinPendingHits=1
;
; The maximum number of hit log entries that can be kept in memory before they are flushed to disk outside of Acrylic's
; idle cicle.
;
HitLogMaxPendingHits=8192
;
; ALLOWING REQUESTS FROM OTHER COMPUTERS
;
; Although for security reasons the default behaviour of Acrylic is to refuse to handle requests coming from other
; computers, it is possible to specify in the AllowedAddressesSection a list of IP addresses or IP subnets from which
; can come requests that Acrylic is allowed to handle. You have to specify a different key name for each entry, like in
; the following example:
;
; [AllowedAddressesSection]
; IP1=192.168.45.254 -- A single IP address
; IP2=192.168.44.100 -- Another single IP address
; IP3=192.168.100.* -- All addresses starting with 192.168.100
; IP4=172.16.* -- All addresses starting with 172.16
;
; For performance reasons keep the number of addresses listed in this section as low as possible (you should try to
; specify subnets instead of large lists of IP addresses whenever possible).
;
; Note: Wildcards (like 192.168.100.*) are allowed. Although not recommended for security reasons you can allow Acrylic
; to handle requests coming from any IP address, like in the following example:
;
; [AllowedAddressesSection]
; IP1=*
;
[AllowedAddressesSection]
;
; The CacheExceptionsSection section below may contain a list of domain names for which caching does not occur (requests
; are always forwarded to the DNS servers). This may be useful if you have a small subset of IP addresses that change
; rapidly but you don't want to loose the performance improvements of Acrylic's address cache for all the other domain
; names.
;
; Example:
;
; [CacheExceptionsSection]
; NAME1=somemachine.mydomain.local
; NAME2=*.microsoft.com
;
; Note: Wildcards (like *.microsoft.com) are allowed.
